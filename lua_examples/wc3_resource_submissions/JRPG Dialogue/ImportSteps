Installation instructions:

    1)  Copy the "import" folder and paste it into your map.

    2)  Export the .fdf and .toc file from the Asset Manager (F12). Their file path names need to remain the same or you
        will need to edit the BlzLoadTOCFile call under the 'speak init' script.

        If you desire the included custom text, also export the 'consolas.ttf' file.

        If you DO NOT want the included custom text, open the .toc file in a text editor and remove/uncomment lines as instructed
        in the file.

    3)  If you desire the demo graphics for testing purposes, export the character portraits from the Asset Manager (F12).
    
        note: for steps 2 and 3, an "export all" option exists by right clicking a file or by going to File -> Export All Files
        note: reminder that changed file strings for 2) and 3) will break things; make sure they match the demo's path naming.

    4)  Copy the scene camera from the Camera Palette (sceneCam) OR create your own camera in your map and replace the variable
        'self.scenecam' with your new camera object under 'speak:init()', which can be found under the 'speak' script file.

    5)  Reference the function documentation and examples, then start building your scenes. Let me know if you encounter any
        bugs or have any code or feature suggestions: Planetary @hiveworkshop.com
