# Champions of Azeroth

A MOBA that attempted to bring the team-wide experience and leveling system from Heroes of the Storm (Blizzard) to the WC3 custom map scene.

The code itself was my first introduction to complex, connected micro-systems. (Thus, it is spaghetti - but it is here to remind me of what improvement looks like!)

Gameplay was somewhat of a dud, and I ultimately abandoned the project due to low interest from the community.

A post-hoc analysis leads me to believe a re-work would be more successful by:
+ Restricting map size, to get players closer together and experience more action (less walking around).
+ Implementing a custom UI component for selecting attributes.
+ Expanding attribute selection to more levels (currently it uses the item system and caps at 6).
+ Make hero abilities more devastating; damage and healing should have higher alpha values to encapsulate quick response times and decision making.
