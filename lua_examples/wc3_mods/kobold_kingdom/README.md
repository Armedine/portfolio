Kobold Kingdom is a total-conversion action RPG for Warcraft 3: Reforged.

It features a pure-Lua context that powers the following core features:
- Custom user-interface that replaces entire WC3 UI
- Procedural world generation
- World state engine (load/play/finish generate levels)
- Attribute-based treasure class (similar to Diablo and Torchlight)
- Save/Load with unlimited local data
- And much more.
