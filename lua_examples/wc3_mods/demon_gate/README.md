# Demon Gate

![Demon Gate Example](demon_gate_example_PNG.png)

This project is on pause, but was set to be a wave-based survival rogue-lite-type-thing map.

Players would roll randomized units as they complete unique waves of combatants and bosses, "building" their army to take advantage of specific traits or strategies.

Atomspherically, the map used a custom model for every unit, courtesy of https://hiveworkshop.com/, to match a Warhammer Fantasy vibe.
