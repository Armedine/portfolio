 # Email Marketing & Templating

 This is a work in progress.

 My email code currently powers all of carvana.com's templates via Iterable snippets, where campaign managers dynamically build out content and customize it for the design provided by the design team.

 To date, I have been responsible for the code used in 2 billion production emails to customers.
